        "**Approach:**  \n",
        "1. Aggregate observations into hourly buckets per city (to stabilize noisy minute-level readings).  \n",
        "2. Compute `temp_hour_avg` per `city, ts_hour`.  \n",
        "3. Compute `temp_delta_1h = temp_hour_avg - LAG(temp_hour_avg)` within each city ordered by hour.  \n",

        "- Confirmed `ts_hour` increments by 1 hour.\n",
        "- Confirmed delta sign interpretation:\n",
        "  - Positive delta → warming\n",
        "  - Negative delta → cooling\n",
        "  - Near zero → stable\n",

        "**Conclusion:**  \n",
        "Because Looker Studio cannot compute windowed deltas on the fly, the correct design is to precompute hour-over-hour changes in BigQuery and visualize them directly. This keeps the dashboard accurate, fast, and aligned with real-time streaming ingestion.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Next improvement:**  \n",
        "Add a categorical status field (Rising/Falling/Stable) using a threshold (e.g., |delta| < 0.2 → Stable) to make the KPI easier to interpret at a glance.\n"
